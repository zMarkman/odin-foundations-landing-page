This is a practice frontend project that takes a provided design 
and translates it into a pseudo-production HTML + CSS state. 

The purpose is to practice web development workflow with the skills
learned so far approximately 1-month into The Odin Project. 

Project goals:
 -Practice workflow after layout
 -Practice code comment habits
 -Practice version control and git habits
 -Practice problem solving for first-sight issues

Success looks like a landing page with completed rudimentary design
and additions. 

Success includes good habits and code commenting practices in addition to 
a deliverable landing page HTML and CSS.

This may be considered for portfolio display if demonstrating understanding
of basic workflow. This may be part of a demo portfolio case study.
